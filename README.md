# The Digital Day

## Description
**The Digital Day** is a conceptual web project inspired by Don Norman's (The Design of Everyday Things, 1988) idea of a new way of reestructuring time by reimagining how we perceive it. Inspired by the idea of transitioning from the traditional time system to a **digital time system**, the project showcases how a day can be divided into **10 digital hours**, each consisting of **100 digital minutes**, and each minute containing **100 digital seconds**.

This system introduces a more intuitive metric-based approach to timekeeping, simplifying conversions and eliminating the need for AM/PM cycles. The Digital Day aims to challenge our traditional understanding of time and encourage new ways of thinking about temporal systems.


## How It Works
The digital day is calculated based on the current real-world time:
- **10 digital hours** = 1 real-world day (24 hours)
- **1 digital hour** = 2.4 real-world hours (144 real-world minutes)
- **1 digital minute** = 1.44 real-world minutes (86.4 real-world seconds)
- **1 digital second** = 0.864 real-world seconds


## Technologies Used
- **React**: To create the interactive UI components
- **CSS**: For styling, animations, and transitions
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For calculations and dynamic updates
